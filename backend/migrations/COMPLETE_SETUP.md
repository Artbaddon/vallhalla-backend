## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Full Reset with Test Data
```bash
npm run db:reset
```
This will:
1. Drop and recreate the database
2. Create all tables
3. Populate with comprehensive test data (150+ records)

### Option 2: Fresh Install with Minimal Data
```bash
npm run db:fresh
```
This will:
1. Drop and recreate the database
2. Create all tables
3. Populate only reference data (no test records)

### Option 3: Step by Step
```bash
# 1. Run migration
npm run migrate

# 2. Choose your seeding option:
npm run seed        # Full test data
npm run seed:basic  # Minimal data only
```

## 📊 What Gets Created

### All Seeders (`npm run seed`)

| Category | Records | Details |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Towers** | 6 | Tower A, B, C, D, North, South |
| **Users** | 16 | Admin, Owners, Security Guards |
| **Profiles** | 16 | Full profile info for all users |
| **Owners** | 9 | Property owners (some tenants) |
| **Guards** | 5 | Security guards with shifts |
| **Apartments** | 13 | Across all towers |
| **Facilities** | 7 | Pool, Gym, Party Room, etc. |
| **Reservations** | 4 | Past, current, future |
| **Vehicles** | 8 | Cars, motorcycles, bikes, etc. |
| **Parking Spots** | 9 | Regular, visitor, disabled |
| **Pets** | 8 | Dogs and cats with records |
| **PQRS** | 5 | Various priorities |
| **Payments** | 6 | Different statuses |
| **Surveys** | 5 | Active and draft |
| **Questions** | 8 | Various question types |
| **Answers** | 5 | Sample responses |
| **Visitors** | 5 | Current and past |
| **Notifications** | 14 | System and user-specific |
| **TOTAL** | **150+** | Complete test dataset |

### Basic Seeder (`npm run seed:basic`)

Only creates reference data:
- ✅ Roles (Admin, Owner, Security)
- ✅ Statuses (for users, apartments, parking, etc.)
- ✅ Categories (PQRS, notifications, etc.)
- ✅ Types (questions, reservations, etc.)
- ✅ 1 Admin user (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`)

## 🔑 Test Credentials

After running `npm run seed`:

| Role | Username | Password | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Admin** | admin | password123 | Active |
| **Owner** | testowner | password123 | Active |
| **Owner** | owner2 | password123 | Active |
| **Owner** | owner3 | password123 | Active |
| **Security** | testsecurity | password123 | Active |
| **Security** | guard1 | password123 | Active |
| **Security** | guard2 | password123 | Active |

**All users** created by seeders use password: `password123`

## 📝 Available NPM Scripts

## 🔧 Customization

### Add Your Own Seeders

1. Create a new file in `seeders/` folder
2. Follow the naming convention: `##_seed_description.js`
3. Export an async function that returns `{ success: true/false }`
4. Add it to `seed_all.js`

Example:
```javascript
export async function seedMyData() {
  let connection;
  try {
    connection = await mysql.createConnection(dbConfig);
    console.log('🌱 Seeding my data...');
    
    // Your seeding logic here
    
    console.log('   ✓ Data created');
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('   ❌ Error:', error);
    return { success: false, error };
  } finally {
    if (connection) await connection.end();
  }
}
```

### Modify Existing Seeders

Each seeder is independent and can be modified without affecting others. Just edit the file and run it again.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Foreign Key Errors
**Solution:** Run seeders in order (01, 02, 03...) or use `npm run seed`

### Duplicate Entry Errors
**Solution:** Drop database and run `npm run db:reset`

### Connection Refused
**Solution:** Check database is running and `.env` credentials are correct

### Need to Reset Everything
```bash
npm run db:reset
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **README.md** - Complete migration & seeder documentation
- **MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - Overview of migration changes
- **SEEDERS_GUIDE.md** - Detailed seeder information
- **Individual seeder files** - Each has inline comments

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Development
```bash
npm run db:reset  # Full reset with test data
```

### For Testing
```bash
npm run db:reset  # Use test data for realistic scenarios
```

### For Production
```bash
npm run db:fresh  # Only reference data
# Then manually add real users/data
```
